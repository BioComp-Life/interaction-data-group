# Species Interaction Data Group

This repository is designated to organize, collect, share and discuss species interaction data. The main objectives of the interaction data group at this initial work comtemplate the follow elements:

* **List of what is avaible:**
  * Data aggreagator [e.g. GloBI] (http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org).
  * Standalone system.
* ** Interaction Data: **
  * Biotic factors of interaction data.
  * Abiotic factors of interaction data.
* ** Definitions: **
  * Set of very basic definitions.
  * Ontologies [e.g. https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Ontologies-and-Vocabularies] (https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Ontologies-and-Vocabularies).
* ** Species interaction granularity: **
  * What level? Taxa level x Individual level.
  * What types of ecological interactions? Symbosis, competition, comensalism, parasitism, etc. OR behavoural description of interaction: visiting flower, eats a prey, inhibition of grow, etc.
* ** Interactions for all taxa: **
  * Microorganisms x Macroscopic organisms?
  * Viruses?
* ** Data Formats - Standards: **
  * What is necessary to digitize interaction data?
  * What is necessary to aggregate interaction data?
