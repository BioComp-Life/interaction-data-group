# Species Interaction Data Group

## Rationale

Species interaction is a concern in Biology and either in other areas, like Agriculture. Despite many efforts to collect and share species interaction data, its lacks a data standard which allows universally exchange of data and information.
Therefore, the goal of this Interest Group is to discuss and formalize biodiversity interaction data aiming at developing a data standard under the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) umbrella.

After a meeting held during the TDWG Conference in Costa Rica, on the 6/Dec/2016, this group was proposed and presented to the TDWG community at the closing session.
Since it is not yet a formal TDWG group we will work under this BioComp-USP GitHub repository, and we will move to TDWG repository as soon as we have an Interest Group on Interaction Data approved by the TDWG exec.

## Planned steps

1. Collect information of available resources about species interaction data, creating a list and providing a detailed description of funcionalities, advantages and disadvantages of each resource.
2. Share bibliography references (articles, reports, documents etc.) between collaborators to enrich discussions and promote a standarization of species data.
3. Create a data standard for species interaction.
