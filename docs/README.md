# Species Interaction Data Group

This repository has been set up for those interested in discussing biodiversity interaction data aiming at developing a data standard under the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) umbrella.
After a meeting held during the TDWG Conference in Costa Rica, on the 6/Dec/2016, this group was proposed and presented to the TDWG community at the closing session.
Since it is not yet a formal TDWG group we will work under this BioComp-USP GitHub repository, and we will move to TDWG repository as soon as we have an Interest Group on Interaction Data approved by the TDWG exec.

Participation is open to all interested parties.
